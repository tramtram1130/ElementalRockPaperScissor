### Learning Goals:

- Showcase an understanding Javascript, HTML, and CSS through making an interactive game against a computer.
- Understand data model and how its data is displayed on the DOM.

### Wins + Challenges:
A great challenge was creating a solution to allow one player autonomy to decide their own fighter selection while limiting the other player to a randomized fighter. It was a big win once that was figured out. Another challenge was adhering to the project's requirement while still maintaining creative freedom.
